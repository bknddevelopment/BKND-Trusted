## 8. Critical Issues for Immediate Fix

### Priority 1 - Performance (Blocking)
1. **LCP of 14.7s** - Must reduce below 2.5s
2. **No code splitting** - Implement dynamic imports
3. **Large bundle size** - Needs optimization

### Priority 2 - Accessibility (High)
1. **Fix color contrast violations**
2. **Add missing lang attributes**
3. **Ensure all pages have proper titles**

### Priority 3 - Responsive (Medium)
1. **Fix overlapping elements on state pages**
2. **Optimize touch targets for mobile**

---

## 9. Recommendations for Transformation

### Performance Optimizations Needed
1. Implement image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)
2. Add code splitting and dynamic imports
3. Optimize JavaScript bundle (tree shaking)
4. Implement proper caching strategies
5. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)

### Design System Requirements
1. Ensure all colors meet WCAG AA contrast ratios
2. Implement proper focus states
3. Add loading states and skeletons
4. Create smooth, performant animations

### Accessibility Improvements
1. Complete ARIA labeling
2. Implement skip navigation
3. Add keyboard shortcuts
4. Improve focus management
